   SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       char *strchr(char const *s, int c);

       char *strrchr(char const *s, int c);

   DESCRIPTION
       The  strchr() function returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the
       character c in the string s.

       The strrchr() function returns a pointer to the last occurrence of  the
       character c in the string s.

       Here  "character"  means "byte" - these functions do not work with wide
       or multi-byte characters.

   RETURN VALUE
       The strchr() and strrchr() functions return a pointer  to  the  matched
       character or NULL if the character is not found.
